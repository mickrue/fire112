This is an Android application, created for fun and my fire fighter friends in my village ...

I'm a voluntary fire-fighter in my village and just out of curiosity how to create an Android app I was looking for a fun project to 
get me started. This is it - an Android app which my fire fighter friends can use to get reminders about upcoming training sessions they
should be part of.

The app is not very sophisticated and completely written in Java (not Kotlin, which came later). It will download an XML file from some 
configured web-server in the App. The XML file can be generated using a little command line tool (fox2app) which is another project hosted 
here (C++ / Qt).
